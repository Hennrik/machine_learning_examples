# Machine learning using golearn

This Readme file illustrates how to implement several machine learning algorithms using golang's golearn library based on the [Mike's blog](https://xyclade.github.io/MachineLearning/).

## Enviroment configurations
1. Go Enviroment
Please refer to [this blog](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang/blob/master/en/01.1.md) to  install and configure your own Go development environment.It is much easier to use the second method *Using the standard installation packages*.
**Note:** Remember to write your *GOPATH*,*GOROOT*,and current *PATH* to your **bashrc**

2. Go development tool 
Install *GoSublime*, *SidebarEnhancements* and *Go Build* in your Sublime Text.
You can still refer to [the same blog](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang/blob/master/en/01.4.md) for details.

3. Start Golearn
Follow the instruction in [this blog](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn)
**Note:** Don't forget to change the dataset path when you test the first *knn* example.
Till now, you can run some machine learning code in the example folder.
